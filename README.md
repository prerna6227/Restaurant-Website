# Restaurant-Website
🍽️ Restaurant Website – Home Page (HTML &amp; CSS)
Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3

This project is a fully responsive restaurant landing page created using pure HTML and CSS to demonstrate a clean, contemporary, and user-friendly design suitable for modern dining businesses. The homepage serves as a complete showcase of a restaurant’s digital front door experience — combining aesthetic visuals, structured content, and intuitive navigation without the use of JavaScript or backend logic.

🌟 Project Highlights

✔ Hero & Welcome Section:
The homepage opens with a bold brand identity, introducing “Tasty” — a restaurant concept focused on delicious Italian cuisine. A prominent hero section showcases the restaurant theme with large typography and visual spacing to immediately engage visitors.

✔ About & Story Section:
The design includes a welcoming section that introduces the restaurant with descriptive text and brand narrative. Its purpose is to connect with visitors instantly by conveying the cuisine style and restaurant history.

✔ Reservation Call-to-Action:
A visually striking “Book a Table” section encourages users to make a reservation. The placement of operating hours and reservation prompts enhances usability by making key actions easily accessible.

✔ Featured Menu Display:
The homepage features a structured menu listing with categories such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dessert, and Beverages. Each item includes a name, short description, and prices — offering a realistic snapshot of the restaurant’s offerings, similar to professional restaurant sites.
